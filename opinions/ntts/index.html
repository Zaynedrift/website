WIP, heres some stuff that I wrote randomly while outside at 1am about it though, its basically just a really big fuck you to lavernie/arsinev<br><br><br>

<br>I have no problem with the creator, 
<br>he's still my go-to for most discord related news. 
<br>It's his server that's the problem. 
<br>It has been deteriorating for a while now for multiple different reasons. 
<br>I'm writing this while I'm annoyed at something else so don't mind if I swear but god fucking damn wobin(?)/lavernie/"the ntts co-owner" is one of the most ridiculous nutcases I've come across in my time on the internet. 
<br>From sugarcoating "i don't like you" to make it bannable (i.e in my case "starting drama") to favourtism to "allegedly" talking about sexual topics to minors in voice channels. 
<br>It's basically a clout chase at this point, 
<br>I cannot even count how many times lavernie has tried to silence people just because they make her seem less important, 
<br>well guess what? 
<br>This is my website. 
<br>I can say ANYTHING thats legal. 
<br>This isnt defamation, 
<br>this is facts based off my (and other's) experience of having to mentally deal with your dumbass to try to keep a server we like alive and healthy. 
<br>Then she deletes all evidence, even switching accounts and mass deleting all her messages. 
<br>Like it's obvious she's trying to hide something, 
<br>even the stupidest fuck could understand that. 
<br>Now I will admit I wasnt a good member in ntts, 
<br>I was dealing with a lot of shit like trying to figure out if I even want to be alive on this earth.
<br>But lavernie didn't help that, 
<br>no one did. 
<br>Now I don't like to say it but after getting banned I still to this day have a faint scar that spells out "fuck you lavernie" on the back of my leg. 
<br>but this isnt about me, 
<br>it's about lavernie and the other forgetful cunts who would meatride her into oblivion making the ntts server absolute fucking cancer. 
<br>Oh also in my appeal lavernie said "don't pull the mental health card" well what fucking card was I meant to pull?
<br>Thats what happened and you all did was make it worse. 
<br>I lost people who i thought were my friends because of your bullshit and lie spreading.
<br>The last thing I did was fuck around with a skid, 
<br>which you would've done too.
<br>Using that as a reason to ban me just because you don't like me is absurd.
<br>do you think this is a rant?
<br>well this is just me pouring out my soul to people,
<br>the pain I had to go through dealing with the shit you pulled while I was just trying to get by with making friends,
<br>even funnier you locked me out of a voice chat with my friends before banning me
<br>fucking pathetic
<br>"we don't hate you" fucking liar.
<br>I hope your grave is cold
